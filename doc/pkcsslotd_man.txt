NAME

pkcsslotd

SYNOPSIS

pkcsslotd

DESCRIPTION

The pkcsslotd daemon receives and processes PKCS#11 requests from
PKCS#11-enabled applications. The daemon manages the cryptographic
tokens and routes requests between the tokens and the applications.

NOTES

Only one instance of the pkcsslotd daemon should be running on any
given host. If a prior instance of pkcsslotd did not shut down
cleanly, then it will leave allocated a shared memory segment with key
0x6202AB38, which the user must manually remove with the following
command:

ipcrm -M 0x6202AB38
