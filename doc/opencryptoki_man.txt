NAME

openCryptoki - A PKCS#11 implementation

DESCRIPTION

openCryptoki is an implementation of the PKCS#11 API standard. It
provides an interface to the functions of underlying cryptographic
tokens, which may be implemented via software or hardware.

To use openCryptoki, first run pkcs11_startup to initialize the
contents of the pk_config_data file. Then run the pkcsslotd daemon. At
this point, openCryptoki is ready to start receiving PKCS#11 requests
from user applications.

Use the pkcsconf utility to further configure openCryptoki once the
daemon is running.
