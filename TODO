Proper exit from pkcsslotd.  Catch the signal and gracefully
shutdown.  This should avoid the shared memory failure to
shut down.

Hardware version and firmware versions are currently hard coded
in usr/lib/pkcs11/methods/leeds_slot/pkcs_slot.bash. Query from
card if possible in InitSharedMemory in pkcsslotd/shmem.c.
